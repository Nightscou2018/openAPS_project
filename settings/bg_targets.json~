//the “offset” entry is the minutes since midnight for that particular targe//t to start. The profile always starts with a midnight rate ##first, //offset//is 0. The next BG target, in this example, starts at 6 am and therefore ha//s an offset of 360 minutes (6 hours from ##midnight at 60 minutes per hour).//Target range can have the same bg value for high and low, if desired, but //be careful not to have a high ##target set lower than the low target.

//You can add or delete bg targets to the sample file below, but pay close a//ttention to syntax. The last bg target range in the profile ##needs end with//out a comma after the last }
